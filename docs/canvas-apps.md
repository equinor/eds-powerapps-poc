# Canvas apps

## Theming

There’s an unoffical tool called [Theme Editor][] that can be used to create a theme. This is apparently _not_ what everyone is waiting for as it’s older than some forum posts where it’s announced that theming of Power Apps will come some time after October 2020. This is a bit confusing.

## Source control

A canvas app can be exported as a .msapp file, which is basically a zip-file. This file can be extraced using an app called PASopa, mentioned in a blog post called [“Source code files for Canvas apps”][] from January 14. The app itself can be cloned from a Github repo, and must be built with .NET to be used.
