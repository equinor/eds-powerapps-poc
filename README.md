# EDS Power Apps POC

This repository is for evaluating how to support Power Apps in the [Equinor Design System](https://eds.equinor.com). The content will be moved to the [EDS repo](https://github.com/equinor/design-system) once we know what weâ€™re doing ðŸ˜‰ Weâ€™re currently using Github actions to export and import into different environments, but we also keep an eye on the [ALM Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit) in the CoE Start Kit, so we may switch to that at some point once they have the Github version up and and running.

The first MVP will be a modification of [Bulb Digitals template](https://www.bulb.digital/blog/simplify-your-powerapps-branding-with-a-theme-template), which again is inspired by the work of [IAmManCat (Sancho Harker)](https://github.com/iAmManCat).

## License

We use an MIT license in the EDS. The Bulb Digital template does not have a license, but weâ€™ve clarified with Michael Wright in Bulb Digital that we can modifiy their template under an MIT license.
